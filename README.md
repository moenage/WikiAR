Jobby Fair is a proof of concept of using AR to connect people through the internet. Our demo on Figma demonstrates how this may be implemented in the future with a website full of targets that can be scanned by users, and our backend Mongo DB and Node.js with a bit of React and Express that will allow people to upload their own QR code and titles. We unfortunately could not connect the frontend and the backend together but the core functionality is out there for future endeavors!

This project won the Echo3D sponsor prize in the 2022 SFU Surge Stormhacks!
